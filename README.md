This is a collection of webpages used to display the output of sample php codes used while learning the language.
A sample minesweeper grid is provided at the end of chapter 6. 
This is a project that was made while I was learning php.
This was an attempt to make the learning process interesting.
These webages are build using HTML, CSS and PHP.
